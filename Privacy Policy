Privacy Policy – Fitness Blueprint
Last updated: 1 September 2025

Thank you for choosing Fitness Blueprint (“the App”, “we”, “our”). Your privacy is important to us. We do not collect, store, or share any personal data on our servers. All content you create remains on your device under your control.

Information the App Touches
1.1 Fitness Content You Enter
• Workout plans, logs, goals, schedules, and settings you create are processed and stored only on your device. They do not leave your device unless you explicitly export or back them up.

1.2 Saved Data (On-Device)
• Any data the App saves is kept in the App’s private container on your device (and, if you have iCloud Backup enabled, inside your own iCloud account).
• We cannot see, access, or retrieve these files.

1.3 Purchase Records (Optional)
• If you make in‑app purchases, Apple provides an anonymized transaction receipt with no personal identifiers. The receipt may be stored locally (e.g., in Keychain) only so the App can recognize your purchase.
• We do not receive or store your payment details.

1.4 Diagnostics (Optional)
• If you opt in to Apple’s “Share With App Developers,” Apple may send us de‑identified crash logs and usage statistics. These do not include content you enter or information that directly identifies you.
• We do not use any third‑party analytics SDKs.

How We Use This Information
• To provide the fitness planning and tracking features you request.
• To remember unlocked features after a purchase.
We do not use any information for advertising, tracking, or profiling.
Where Your Data Lives
• Your device – plans, logs, settings, and any local purchase receipts.
• Apple iCloud (only if you enable iCloud Backup) – your encrypted device backup that may include the App’s data.
We run no servers that store personal data, and the App never uploads your data to us or to third parties.
Your Rights & Choices
Because your personal content remains on your device, you can:
• Edit or delete your plans and logs at any time within the App.
• Remove the App to erase its local data and purchase receipts; you may also delete the App’s iCloud backup in iOS Settings ▸ Apple ID ▸ iCloud ▸ Manage Storage.
• Turn off “Share With App Developers” in iOS Settings ▸ Privacy & Security ▸ Analytics & Improvements to stop diagnostic sharing.
If you contact us asking for deletion, we can only guide you through the steps above, as we hold no data that we can erase on your behalf.

Security
• All processing happens locally; no network transmission of your fitness data occurs.
• Any communication with Apple’s servers (e.g., for in‑app purchases) is encrypted with HTTPS/TLS.
• Apple Keychain and iCloud Backup encrypt data at rest and in transit.
Children
Fitness Blueprint is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy as the App evolves. New versions will appear here and inside the App. Continued use after an update means you accept the revised policy.
